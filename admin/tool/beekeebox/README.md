A Moodle administration plugin providing a GUI to some settings and management of a [BeekeeBox](https://beekeebox.net/), a Moodle server installed on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

This plugin enables a Moodle administrator to monitor some hardware settings, to set the date of the BeekeeBox, to allow restart and shutdown of the BeekeeBox and changing Raspberry Pi passwords using a GUI. After the installation in Moodle, some steps are required to complete on the Raspberry Pi (see below).

The plugin is compatible with Moodle 3.3 or later. A Raspberry Pi model 3B or 3B+ is recommended.

## Installation

The BeekeeBox plugin must be installed in the Moodle tree of the BeekeeBox, in the _tool_ folder. Once installed, an new option _BeekeeBox_ will be available in Moodle, under _Site administration > Server_ in the _Administration_ block.

To complete the installation, you have to configure some incron jobs on the BeekeeBox.

1. Install `incron` package and allow `root` to run it:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install incron
    echo root | sudo tee -a /etc/incron.allow
    ```

1. Add following lines to `incrontab`:
    ```bash
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.reboot-server IN_CLOSE_WRITE /sbin/shutdown -r now
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.shutdown-server IN_CLOSE_WRITE /sbin/shutdown -h now
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.set-server-datetime IN_CLOSE_WRITE /bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.set-server-datetime
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.newpassword IN_CLOSE_WRITE /bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/bin/changepassword.sh
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.wifisettings IN_CLOSE_WRITE /bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/bin/changewifisettings.sh
    /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/.resize-partition IN_CLOSE_WRITE /bin/bash /var/www/moodle/admin/tool/beekeebox/bin/resizepartition.sh
    ```

    ```
